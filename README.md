# Clipboard Sync (Windows Tray App)

> Former name: **Clipboard Sender** (renamed in v1.0.1 after adding *receive* support)

**Clipboard Sync** is a lightweight Windows tray app for **Notemod-selfhosted** that makes clipboard sharing *bidirectional*:

- **Send**: Windows clipboard → Notemod-selfhosted (write)
- **Receive**: Notemod-selfhosted → Windows clipboard → *(optional)* auto **paste (Ctrl+V)** with one hotkey

It also supports scheduled **INBOX cleanup** and (if backups are enabled on the server) a one-click **backup file purge** from the Settings screen.

## Highlights
- When disabled, the specifications have been changed so that both automatic deletion of backup files and receiving data to the clipboard are stopped.

## Features

- Tray app (no main window), click tray icon to enable/disable sending
- Global hotkey to toggle sending
- **Send** clipboard text to Notemod-selfhosted (POST)
- **Receive** latest note via `read_api.php` (GET) and copy to clipboard
  - Optional **auto paste** right after receive (Ctrl+V)
  - Optional “clipboard stabilize wait (ms)” before pasting
- Cleanup settings:
  - Manual **Delete all INBOX notes**
  - Auto delete **daily** or **every X minutes**
- Backup maintenance (when Notemod-selfhosted backup is enabled):
  - Show **current backup file count**
  - One-click **purge all backup files**
- Optional **Basic Auth** support
- UI languages: English / 日本語 / Türkçe

## Intended use

This app is designed to work with **Notemod-selfhosted** (server) + **Clipboard Sync** (Windows) + iPhone Shortcuts / Back Tap.

Example:
- Copy text on iPhone → (Notemod-selfhosted saves it) → press *Receive hotkey* on Windows → paste into the active app.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- .NET 8 Desktop Runtime (for running the released EXE)
- A working **Notemod-selfhosted** installation providing:
  - `api.php` (write / send)
  - `read_api.php` (read / receive)
  - `cleanup_api.php` (INBOX delete + backup purge)

> If your Notemod-selfhosted is protected by Basic Auth, configure it in Settings.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from GitHub Releases.
2. Run the EXE.
3. Open **Settings** from the tray menu and set URLs / tokens.

## Build (for developers)

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 8 SDK
- Windows Forms workload

### Steps

1. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
2. Build / publish.
3. Ensure icons are included correctly (see next section).

## About embedding icons/resources (Resources)

Tray icons are embedded resources (so the tray icon works even when running from a single folder).

- `Assets/tray_on.ico` → EmbeddedResource
- `Assets/tray_off.ico` → EmbeddedResource
- `Assets/app.ico` → ApplicationIcon

## Security / Privacy

- The app sends only the clipboard text you copy (when sending is enabled).
- Tokens/passwords are stored in `settings.json` with **DPAPI encryption** (Windows user profile scope).
- Consider using HTTPS and Basic Auth if you expose the server on the internet.
